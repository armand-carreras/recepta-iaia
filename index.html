        <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

        <p>Ingredients
        1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
        1/2 cup unsalted butter
        3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        1/4 cup water
        3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        1/4 cup water
        1/2 cup white sugar
        1/2 cup packed brown sugar
        8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</p>

        <p>Directions
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
        flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
        temperature and let simmer.</p>

        <p>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
        lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
        that it does not run off.</p>

        <p>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
